Click on "X Server Display Configuration". If you have multiple monitors choose the one you want to setup for stereo. Select the Resolution (do not choose "Auto"). Select the refresh rate (to the right of "Resolution"). You want a refresh rate at least 100Hz (120Hz or faster is better). Click "Apply".
