How to use jupyter notebook SSH remote Raspberry Pi on computer
To use Jupyter Notebook via SSH remote connection to a Raspberry Pi from your computer, follow these steps:

Step 1: Check SSH Access to Raspberry Pi
Ensure Network Connection: Make sure that the Raspberry Pi is connected to the same network as your computer.
Obtain IP Address: Find the IP address of your Raspberry Pi. You can do this by running hostname -I on the Raspberry Pi.
Test SSH Access: Verify that you can connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH from your computer. Open a terminal on your computer and run:
sh
ssh pi@<RaspberryPi_IP>
Replace <RaspberryPi_IP> with the actual IP address of your Raspberry Pi. You should be prompted to enter the Raspberry Pi's password.
Step 2: Setting Up and Accessing Jupyter Notebook
Install Jupyter Notebook: Once connected to your Raspberry Pi via SSH, install Jupyter Notebook by running:

sh
sudo apt-get install jupyter-notebook
Start Jupyter Notebook: Start the Jupyter Notebook server on the Raspberry Pi by running:

sh
jupyter-notebook --no-browser --port=8888
This will start Jupyter Notebook on port 8888 without opening a browser.

Create SSH Tunnel: On your computer, open a new terminal and create an SSH tunnel to forward the Jupyter Notebook port to your local machine. Run:

sh
ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 pi@<RaspberryPi_IP>
This command forwards port 8888 on the Raspberry Pi to port 8888 on your local machine.

Follow-up Steps
Access Jupyter Notebook: Open a web browser on your computer and navigate to http://localhost:8888. You should see the Jupyter Notebook interface, and you can start using it as if it were running locally on your computer.
By following these steps, you can use Jupyter Notebook on your Raspberry Pi remotely from your computer via SSH.
